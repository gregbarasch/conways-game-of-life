# Conway's Game of Life

This is a simple recreation of the [The Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) written by
John Conway in 1970.

Done as a little makerweek project, the intention was to learn typescript and related technologies + to have some fun 
with Phaser 3.

Enjoy
